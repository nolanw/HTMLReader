# HTMLReader

A [WHATWG-compliant HTML parser][whatwg-spec] with [CSS selectors][selectors-level-3] in Objective-C and Foundation. It parses HTML just like a browser.

![Supports iOS, OS X, tvOS, and watchOS](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/HTMLReader.svg)

## Usage

A quick example of parsing an inline document and finding the bold text:

```swift
import HTMLReader

let document = HTMLDocument(string: """
    <p>
        Ahoy there, <b>sailor</b>!
    </p>
    """)
print(document.firstNode(matchingSelector: "b")?.textContent ?? "")
// => sailor
```

Manipulating a document is a little more involved, but entirely doable. Here we take the document from the first example and wrap the paragraph within a new element:

```swift
if
    let p = document.firstNode(matchingSelector: "p"),
    let parent = p.parent
{
    let wrapper = HTMLElement(tagName: "div", attributes: ["class": "special"])
    let children = parent.mutableChildren
    children.insert(wrapper, at: children.index(of: p))
    p.parent = wrapper
}

print(document.innerHTML)
// => <html><head></head><body><div class="special"><p>\
//        Ahoy there, <b>sailor</b>!\
//    </p></div></body></html>
```

Finally, the most involved example: fetching the main page for the HTMLReader repository and scraping the description of the project. (This is just an example; GitHub has a fabulous API that you should use if you want to find a repository's description!)

```objc
@import HTMLReader;

// Load a web page.
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://github.com/nolanw/HTMLReader"];
NSURLSession *session = [NSURLSession sharedSession];
[[session dataTaskWithURL:url completionHandler:
  ^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
    NSString *contentType = nil;
    if ([response isKindOfClass:[NSHTTPURLResponse class]]) {
        NSDictionary *headers = [(NSHTTPURLResponse *)response allHeaderFields];
        contentType = headers[@"Content-Type"];
    }
    HTMLDocument *home = [HTMLDocument documentWithData:data
                                      contentTypeHeader:contentType];
    HTMLElement *div = [home firstNodeMatchingSelector:@".repository-meta-content"];
    NSCharacterSet *whitespace = [NSCharacterSet whitespaceAndNewlineCharacterSet];
    NSLog(@"%@", [div.textContent stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:whitespace]);
    // => A WHATWG-compliant HTML parser in Objective-C.
}] resume];
```

## Installation

You have choices:

* Copy the files in the [Sources](Sources) folder into your project.
* Add the following line to your [Cartfile][Carthage]:

  `github "nolanw/HTMLReader"`
* Add the following line to your [Podfile][CocoaPods]:

   `pod "HTMLReader"`
* Add the following line to your [Package.swift][Swift Package Manager]:

   `.package(url: "https://github.com/nolanw/HTMLReader", from: "2.1.3")`
* Clone this repository (perhaps add it as a submodule) and add `HTMLReader.xcodeproj` to your project/workspace. Then add `HTMLReader.framework` to your app target. (Or, if you're targeting iOS earlier than 8.0: add `libHTMLReader.a` to your app target and `"$(SYMROOT)/include"` to your app target's Header Search Paths.)

HTMLReader has no dependencies other than Foundation.

## Why HTMLReader?

I needed to scrape HTML like a browser. I couldn't find a good choice for iOS.

## The Alternatives

[libxml2][] ships with iOS. It parses some variant of HTML 4 (?) and does not handle new/broken markup like a modern browser.

Other Objective-C and Swift libraries I come across (e.g. [Fuzi][], [hpple][], [Kanna][], [Ono][]) use libxml2 and inherit its shortcomings.

[SwiftSoup][] is a Swift port of Jsoup. It didn't exist when I made HTMLReader. (To be fair, publicly, neither did Swift.)

There are C libraries such as [Gumbo][] or [Hubbub][], but you need to shuffle data to and from Objective-C or Swift. (Also Gumbo wasn't publicly announced until after HTMLReader was far along.)

[WebKit][] ships with iOS, but its HTML parsing abilities are considered private API. I consider a round-trip through a web view inappropriate for parsing HTML. And I didn't make it very far into building my own copy of WebCore.

[Google Toolbox for Mac][GTMNSString+HTML] will escape and unescape strings for HTML (e.g. `&amp;` â‡” `&`) but, again, not like a modern browser. For example, GTM will not unescape `&#65` (note the missing semicolon).

[CFStringTransform][kCFStringTransformToXMLHex] does numeric entities via (the reversible) `kCFStringTransformToXMLHex`, but that rules out named entities.

## Does it work?

HTMLReader continually runs [html5lib][html5lib-tests]'s tokenization and tree construction tests, ignoring the tests for `<template>` (which HTMLReader does not implement). Note that you need to check out the `HTMLReaderTests/html5lib` Git submodule in order to actually run these tests.

HTMLReader is continually built and tested on iOS versions 8.4, 9.3, 10.3, and 11.0; built and tested on macOS versions 10.9, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12, and 10.13; built and tested on tvOS versions 9.2, 10.2, and 11.0; and built on watchOS versions 2.2, 3.2, and 4.0. It should work on down to iOS 5, macOS 10.7, tvOS 9.0, and watchOS 2.0, but there is no automated testing there (it's ok to file an issue though!).

Given all that: [![Build Status](https://github.com/github/docs/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nolanw/HTMLReader/actions/test)

HTMLReader is used by at least [one shipping app][Awful].

## How fast is it?

I'm not sure.

Included in the project is a utility called [Benchmarker][]. It knows how to run three tests:

* Parsing a large HTML file. In this case, the 7MB single-page HTML specification.
* Escaping and unescaping entities in the large HTML file.
* Running a bunch of CSS selectors. Basically copied from [a WebKit performance test][WebKit QuerySelector.html].

Changes to HTMLReader should not cause these benchmarks to run slower. Ideally changes make them run faster!
